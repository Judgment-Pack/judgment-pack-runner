"""Hold the archives of a release to the commit they were built from.

Usage: python3 tools/release_archives.py --dist dist --version 0.1.0 [--tree .]

The release workflow runs this on what GoReleaser wrote, before anything is
attested: it is held of the archives themselves, and not of the
configuration that was meant to make them. For every platform a release is
built for, the archive of that name must hold exactly:

  - the documents, each a file, byte for byte the tree's;
  - the programs, each a file and nothing but a file, built from the
    package of its name, for the archive's operating system and
    architecture and at the processor level a release promises, as the
    executable's own build record says, and executable where the system
    has the bit.

Nothing else may be in it: no other file, no link, no device. Every fault
found is reported, and any fault is a failure.

What this does not establish: that a program behaves. A build record says
what an executable was built from and for; it is read here and not run.
