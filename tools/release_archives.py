"""Hold the archives of a release to the commit they were built from.

Usage: python3 tools/release_archives.py --dist dist --version 0.1.0 [--tree .] [--commit HEAD]

The release workflow runs this on what GoReleaser wrote, before anything is
attested: it is held of the archives themselves, and not of the
configuration that was meant to make them. For every platform a release is
built for, the archive of that name must hold exactly:

  - the documents, byte for byte the commit's;
  - the programs, each one program and not a file of several, built from
    the package of its name, for the archive's operating system and
    architecture and at the processor level a release promises, as the
    executable's own build record says, and readable and executable by
    everyone.

An archive holds files and nothing else: no directory of its own, no link,
no device, no name twice, and no name written any way but the plain one
(no "./", no trailing slash, no backslash). The members' headers are read
first and their contents after, one at a time, and only of members a
release holds; a member larger than any a release has is refused unread.
Every fault found is reported, and any fault is a failure.

What is compared is the commit, not the working tree: a file changed or
removed in the tree after the commit changes nothing here.

What this does not establish: that a program behaves. A build record says
what an executable was built from and for; it is read here, by whatever
`go` is first on the path, and the program is not run. The release workflow
and CI run this with the toolchain a release is built with.
