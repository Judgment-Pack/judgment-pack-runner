"""Write THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES: the licence of everything a released binary links.

Usage: python3 tools/third_party_notices.py [--check]

A release archive carries binaries, and a binary carries the code of every
module it was linked with. This asks the toolchain which packages those are,
for every platform a release is built for, and copies each module's licence
and notice files from the module cache, as downloaded and verified against
go.sum: the ones at the module's root, and the ones in a linked package's
own directory or any directory above it, since a package taken from
elsewhere keeps its own terms beside it. Nothing is fetched here that
`go list` does not fetch, and no licence is named from memory.

The Go toolchain's own licence is copied from the toolchain that runs this,
so the file is written, and checked before a release is packaged, with the
toolchain release.yml names.

With --check nothing is written: the file in the tree is compared with what
would be written, and a difference is a failure. CI runs it so, which is
what keeps the file true when a dependency is added, removed or moved.
