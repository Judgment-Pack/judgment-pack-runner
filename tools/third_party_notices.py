"""Write THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES: the licence of everything a released binary links.

Usage: python3 tools/third_party_notices.py [--check]

A release archive carries binaries, and a binary carries the code of every
module it was linked with. This asks the toolchain which modules those are,
for every platform a release is built for, and copies each one's licence and
notice files from the module cache, as downloaded and verified against
go.sum. Nothing is fetched here that `go list` does not fetch, and no
licence is named from memory.

With --check nothing is written: the file in the tree is compared with what
would be written, and a difference is a failure. CI runs it so, which is
what keeps the file true when a dependency is added, removed or moved.
